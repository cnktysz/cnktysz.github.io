  This is Cenk Tüysüz (/ˈdʒɛŋk tu:jsu:z/). I'm a postdoc @ CERN working on quantum machine learning. I love working on multidisciplinary projects, and in fact, this is what brought me to quantum computing. I enjoy working with people from all around the world. Below is a non-exhaustive list of my current research interests. Feel free to reach out via your favorite platform.

  Research Interests:
  - Generative learning with QML
  - Quantum machine learning (QML); trainability QML models, barren plateaus, warm starts.
  - Geometric machine learning; representation theory, category theory
  - Mitigating hardware noise to maximize utility of current hardware
  - Physics simulations with Quantum Computing
  - High Energy Physics applications of Quantum Computing
